Overview: YThe dataset contains images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its
unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's
species from a photo.

Objective: To identify the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network

Skills and Tools: Keras, CNN, Working With Images, Computer Vision
